  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I am an early career professional with experience working on high-impact projects for small and large organizations. I bring a diverse perspective to problem solving that is a result of my work experience in a variety of industries from wealth management to corporate citizenship to international development to consulting to tech. I am looking for an entry-level role where I will be challenged, learn and grow.</p>
  <p>If you are interested in understanding a little bit more about me, read below. I love meeting new people and connecting over coffee, please don't hesitate to reach out if you want to chat!</p>
  <h2>Community involvement ðŸ‘¥</h2>
  <p>Ever since I took a semester off from school because of my struggle with mental illness, I have advocated for mental health through public speaking, writing and my involvement with Jack.org. I am grateful to have had leadership experience as Co-President of Jack.org Queen's which allowed me to practice strategic planning, project management, team management and public speaking.</p>
  <h2>Work experience ðŸ‘”</h2>
  <p>I was first introduced to strategic problem solving during my internship at RBC Wealth Management where I had the opportunity to research innovation methodologies for a Digital Strategy Leader. Next, I took what I learned to the Corporate Citizenship team at RBC where I worked on donation strategies, created a communication guide and created a framework to identify effective digital mental health solutions for youth. My last internship brought me to Deloitte where I honed my problem solving and communication skills by helping a global organization implement a new HR system.</p>
  <h2>Interests ðŸ“š</h2>
  <p>My experience in the corporate & not for profit world has shaped my interest in shared value, social innovation and social entrepreneurship. As our world faces unprecedented challenges from climate change to rising inequality to a global pandemic, I believe that social entrepreneurship and shared value are the way forward. I want to build new social enterprises, scale existing ones and/or help large organizations find opportunities to merge purpose + profit.</p>
